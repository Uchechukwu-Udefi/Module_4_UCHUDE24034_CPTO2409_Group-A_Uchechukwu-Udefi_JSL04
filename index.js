// # [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

// #### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
// Given a variable that holds a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink, 
// print whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

let userPreference = ''; // Possible values: 'Regular', 'Sugar-free', or undefined
userPreference ? console.log(`Sugar-free`) : console.log(`Regular`);


// #### Challenge 2: Stock Check
// You have a variable that tracks the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. 
// Use a ternary operator to print "Time to restock!" if the number is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number is 5 or more.

let cansLeft = 3; // Any number of cans
cansLeft >= 5 ? console.log(`We're stocked!`) : console.log(`Time to restock!`);

// #### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
// Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. 
// If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

let heartRate = 95; // Current heart rate in bpm
heartRate < 100 ? console.log(`Boost needed!`) : console.log(`Energy levels are high!`);


// #### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
// Monster Energy drinks are best served cold. Given the current temperature, use a ternary to print "Chilled to perfection!" 
// if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

let currentTemp = 6; // Current temperature in °C
currentTemp <= 5 ? console.log(`Chilled to perfection!`) : currentTemp > 5 ? console.log(`Needs a cooler!`) :
console.log(``);


// #### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
// Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour.
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!",
// otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

// Define the current hour in 24-hour format

let currentHour = 24; // Current hour in 24-hour format

// Write your code below this line to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"
// Otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

currentHour >= 7 && currentHour < 24 ? console.log(`Unleash the beast!`) : console.log(`Better stick to water.`);





// In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, 
// they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
